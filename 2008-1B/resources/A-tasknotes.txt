There are 9 combinations of (x mod 3) X (Y mod 3). And this is the only that matters 
to get an aanswer whether (x1+x2+x3) mod 3 == 0 && (y1+y2+y3)/3 mod 3 == 0 are both integers.

Then we just multiply sizes for each 3 sets of points among those 9 sets, where all 3 chosen 
sets are satisfied with condition (x1+x2+x3) mod 3 == 0 && (y1+y2+y3)/3 mod 3 == 0.

And for single set we use formuls n*(n-1)(n-2)/n!, as three points must be different.
